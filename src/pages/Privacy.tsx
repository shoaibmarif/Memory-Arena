      <h2>What stays on your device</h2>
      <p>
        Your settings, rank, XP, statistics, achievements and daily results are saved in your browser’s local storage. They never leave
        your device and we can’t see them. Clearing your browser data, or choosing <strong>Reset all progress</strong> in Settings, deletes
        them.
      </p>

      <h2>Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        We use Google Analytics, loaded through Google Tag Manager, to understand how many people visit, which pages and modes they use,
        and roughly where in the world they are. It sets cookies to tell visits apart. We also record a few game events, such as a game
        finishing or a result being shared, with details like the mode and score.
      </p>
      <p>
        Analytics is on by default. If you’d rather not be counted, choose <strong>Opt out</strong> in the notice, or{' '}

        at any time. Your choice is remembered on this device. Advertising features are always off, and we don’t sell or share data with
        anyone. Google handles this data under its own{' '}

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>
        Memory Arena is suitable for all ages. There are no accounts, chat or ads, and we don’t knowingly collect personal information from
        anyone. Parents who prefer no analytics at all can use the Opt out button.
